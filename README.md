 👋 Hi, I’m @filthyratbaby
 
 👀 I’m interested in basic coding, especially for optimizing data sets common to genetic research
 
 🌱 I’m currently learning a bit of everything, in preparation for my first placement as a biotech
 
 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on _Borrelia burgdorferi_ genome and geographical mapping, any beginner coding projects that are fun, etc.
